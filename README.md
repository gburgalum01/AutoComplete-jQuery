# AutoComplete-jQuery

The code in this repository presents an example of using the AutoComplete jQuery plugin.  It builds on the demos provided by jQuery by providing the enhancements listed below.

1. It implements functionality such that when a value is not chosen, the input textfield reverts to its instructional text. 
2. When a value from the textfield has been selected, the focus on the textfield is dropped.

### Running the Example
Extract all of the files to a folder.  Open the file named autocomplete.html in any web browser.  Start typing the name of a country in the textfield.  Select a value, and the selected value will be displayed as static text below the textfield.
